# servc

A simple http server, to statically serve files (and directories), duh

cuz i be tired of downloading npm packages or doin `pip install -m http-server`
or something like that.

i found another great thing u could do with this, and it's to transfer like 
files over the network idk if it be ideal, but it's easy, just run servc at the
dir from where you want to transfer a file and then from the other machine do
`wget http://thelocalip:port/file` ðŸ”¥
